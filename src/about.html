            <p style="text-align: justify;color: aliceblue;" class="lead">The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus
              pandemic, is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 
              (COVID-19) caused by the transmission of severe acute respiratory
              
              syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first identified in December
               2019 in Wuhan, China. The outbreak was declared a Public Health
                Emergency of International Concern in January 2020 and a pandemic
                 in March 2020. As of 28 October 2020, more than 43.9 million
                  cases have been confirmed, with more than 1.16 million deaths
                   attributed to COVID-19.

              COVID-19 mainly spreads when people are physically close,
               spreading airborne, primarily via small droplets or aerosols,
                as an infected person breathes, coughs, sneezes, sings, or
                 speaks. Transmission via contaminated surfaces has not
                  been conclusively demonstrated, so the air is suspected
                   to be the main mode of transmission. It can spread from
                    an infected person for up to two days before symptoms appear,
                     and from people who are asymptomatic. People remain
                      infectious for up to ten days in moderate cases, and 
                      two weeks in severe cases.
              Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing 
              difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. Complications
               may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
                The incubation period is typically around five days but may
                 range from one to 14 days. There are several vaccine
                  candidates in development, although none have completed
                   clinical trials. There is no known specific antiviral 
                   medication, so primary treatment is currently symptomatic.</p>
